# üö´ Why Reflection Is Not Preferred (Usually)
1. **Performance Overhead**
- Reflection is slower than direct code execution.
- It bypasses many optimizations that the JIT compiler can apply.
- Creating objects with Activator.CreateInstance() or invoking methods via reflection is much more expensive than using new or normal method calls.

Example:
```
csharp
var obj = Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(MyClass)); // Slower
var obj2 = new MyClass();                            // Fast
```

2. **No Compile-Time Type Checking**
With reflection, errors like typos in type names, method names, or property access are only caught at runtime, not during compilation.
This makes the code more error-prone and harder to maintain.

3. **Harder to Read and Maintain**
Reflection-based code is often less readable and less intuitive than regular code.
It‚Äôs harder for developers (including future-you) to follow what‚Äôs happening.

4. **Security Risks**
Reflection can access private members if allowed, which breaks encapsulation and can lead to unintended side effects.
Improper use may expose sensitive parts of your code.
  
  ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Example : 
  Accessing and Modifying a Private Field, one the major reason not to use reflection
  ```
  using System;
using System.Reflection;

public class BankAccount
{
    private double balance = 1000.0;

    public void ShowBalance()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Balance: {balance}");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        var account = new BankAccount();
        account.ShowBalance();  // Balance: 1000

        // Use reflection to access private field
        FieldInfo field = typeof(BankAccount).GetField("balance", BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance);

        if (field != null)
        {
            field.SetValue(account, -5000.0);  // üö® Dangerous!
        }

        account.ShowBalance();  // Balance: -5000
    }
}

  ```
5. **Limited Tooling Support**
Refactoring tools (like rename or find usages in IDEs) don‚Äôt work well with reflection.
Code analysis tools, IntelliSense, etc., can't always track types or usages through reflection.

# ‚úÖ When Reflection Is Useful
Despite these drawbacks, reflection has valid use cases, especially when:
- You're building frameworks, serialization libraries, or dependency injection containers (like ASP.NET Core does internally).
- You need to dynamically load plugins or types (e.g., from DLLs).
- You don‚Äôt know the type at compile time but must work with it.
